I was a teaching assistant for [Xavier Sala-i-Martin](https://www.salaimartin.com/) and his section of Intermediate Macroeconomics.

I held weekly hour-long recitations for 20 - 30 students covering material from lecture in addition to supplemental material.

My teaching materials for this course are available upon request.
